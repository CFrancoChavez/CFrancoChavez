Hello, my name is Franco Chávez. In my repository, I have a Node.js project that follows the model-view-controller pattern (a small e-commerce still under construction), which shows my work as a Full Stack Web Developer within the framework of the project. integrator of Digital House Coding School.
My goal is to make an important change in my professional life by taking my first steps in the world of Full Stack Web Programming.
